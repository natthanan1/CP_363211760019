The little mermaid quietly came to the prince’ room at night.
She kissed him but could not stab him with the knife as she truly loved him.
So, after giving him last one look, she threw herself into the sea.
She found herself in the sky with the daughters of the sky – The twinkling stars.
And now she lives happily and joyfully with them.
